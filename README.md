## Abstract

The percentage of polling on the day of elections is not satisfactory as the majority of people are not coming to vote and think of it as a wastage of time. In our country, 3 out of every 10 people do not vote. The manual voting system takes a long time due to paper-based work and human effort required for counting votes, consuming approximately 4-6 hours (approx.) of every voter's time. This project aims to build an online voting system that allows voters to cast their votes anytime from the comfort of their homes.

## Introduction

An online voting system is a software platform that enables groups to securely conduct votes and elections. Traditional voting methods include ballot papers and electronic voting machines (EVMs), but an online voting system is essential to allow voters to vote from anywhere without much effort. It can improve the vote count and provide accurate results in less time. Online voting can also prevent issues like false votes and booth capturing.

## Literature Survey

Previous research on voting systems has explored various protocols and criteria for secure electronic voting. Some methods focused on voter privacy using encrypted tags and ballots. Others examined the feasibility of running national elections over the Internet. While there have been advancements in remote voting schemes, it is crucial to design a secure and reliable system.

## Proposed Work

To address the challenges mentioned above, we propose an online voting system that eliminates the need for physical presence during elections. Voters will receive a unique key to log in to the election platform and cast their votes conveniently. The Waterfall model will be adopted for the project's development due to the availability of all required input data and the simplicity of the model.

## Project Management

### Project Scheduling

We have prepared Gantt charts, Timeline charts, and PERT charts to schedule and monitor the project's progress. These visual representations help us plan and manage the tasks efficiently.

### Work-Breakdown Structure

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down the project into smaller components, integrating scope, cost, and deliverables. We have categorized the WBS based on phases, deliverables, and responsibilities.

### Data Flow Diagram

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) illustrates the flow of data through the system at various levels. We have created Level-0, Level-1, and Level-2 DFDs to provide a clear understanding of data interactions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Authentication: The system must identify each authorized voter using registered login details and prevent multi-voting.
- Vote Counting: The system should ensure fast and reliable vote counting.
- User Convenience: Voters should be able to log in at any time and place, easily select an election, and cast their vote for any candidate.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Security: The system must use high-level encryption for data transactions and store passwords securely. It should prevent serial attacks and unauthorized access.
- Performance: The system should have reasonably short response times and minimal downtime during the voting process.

## Getting Started

To set up the Online Voting System locally or deploy it to a server, follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md).

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the website.
2. Register for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Select an election and cast your vote for the preferred candidate.
4. View real-time results after voting ends.

## Security

The Online Voting System prioritizes security and data privacy. Advanced encryption techniques will be employed to protect voter data and prevent unauthorized access.
